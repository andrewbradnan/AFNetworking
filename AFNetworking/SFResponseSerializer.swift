 The `SFURLResponseSerialization` protocol is adopted by an object that decodes data into a more useful object representation, according to details in the server response. Response serializers may additionally perform validation on the incoming response and data.
 
 For example, a JSON response serializer may check for an acceptable status code (`2XX` range) and content type (`application/json`), decoding a valid JSON response into an object.
